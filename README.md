"" Taxi Fare Prediction  ””

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that predicts taxi fares based on the distance traveled and pickup time.
The app uses a trained machine learning model to provide fare estimates.

~ Features

    •	User-friendly Interface: The app is built using Tkinter for an easy and intuitive user experience.

    •	Fare Prediction: Input the travel distance and pickup time to get an estimated fare.

    •	Real-time Plot: Visualizes actual and predicted fares on a scatter plot to compare the user’s input with historical fare data.
~ How It Works
1.	Input Fields:
    Enter the travel distance (in kilometers).
    Provide the pickup time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
  	
3.	Fare Prediction:
    Click "Predict Fare" to generate an estimated fare using a pre-trained model.
  	
5.	Plot Visualization:
    View a scatter plot showing actual fares, predicted fares, and your fare estimate.
